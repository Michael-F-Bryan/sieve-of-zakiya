This is the Sieve of Zakiya article posted to Wikipedia
on Friday, December 9 2011. It was deleted on Sunday,
December 18, 2011 for violating various "policies."

However, the content provides a simple and clear 
description/code of the Sieve of Zakiya (SoZ) and is 
much more upto date than my first two papers from 2008.

Additional papers, code, etc, can be downloaded from here:
